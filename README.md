<h1🐄  The Cow Goes...🐄  </h1>
<a href="https://thecowgoes.netlify.app/">Live Demo</a>
<p>This app is for littles. I orginally just wanted to build an simple animal sounds app for my daughter, but couldn't resist the challenge of incorporating a two player memory game.</p>

<p>Created With:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>FontAwesome</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  
  <li>Animal Sounds page displaying animal pictures that when clicked spin and play the respective animal sound.</li>
  <li>The Animal Sounds page can display all 14 animals, or 4 at a time so as not to overstimulate. Clicking on "Four More" button will render four new random animals.</li>
  <li>The memory game is a matching game. It is currently set up for two players,  keeps score and notifies the winning player.</li>
  
</ul>

<h2>Planned Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>More animals sounds with categories.</li>
  <li>One-player option for memory game.</li>
  <li>Varying levels of difficulty for memory game.</li>
</ul>
